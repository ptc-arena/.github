# Contributing to Arena
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the API and examples
- Submitting a fix
- Submitting code snippets and examples
- Proposing new features

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host our API documents and code samples, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests. 
Read <a href="https://github.com/ptc-arena/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">our Code of Conduct</a> to keep our community approachable and respectable.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code snippets that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've added code snippets or other samples, add appropriate documentation of the use case or application.
4. If you are updating documentation, provide the udpated sections in entirety for consideration.
5. Ensure the test suite passes.
6. Make sure your code lints.
7. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/briandk/transcriptase-atom/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs with what is in our repositories. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!
Don't use GitHub issues to log Arena platform bugs or enhancement requests. 

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
[This is an example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) of a bug report I wrote, and I think it's not a bad model. Here's [another example from Craig Hockenberry](http://www.openradar.me/11905408), an app developer whom I greatly respect.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can. [My stackoverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) includes sample code that *anyone* with a base R setup can run to reproduce what I was seeing
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
For more information on how we write our markdown files, see <a href="https://github.com/github/docs/blob/main/contributing/content-markup-reference.md">the GitHub Markdown reference</a>.
I'm again borrowing these from [Facebook's Guidelines](https://github.com/facebook/draft-js/blob/a9316a723f9e918afde44dea68b5f9f39b7d9b00/CONTRIBUTING.md)

* 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
* You can try running `npm run lint` for style unification
